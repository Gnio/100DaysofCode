# 100DaysofCode

I started freecodecamp a while ago, I went through all the HTML, CSS, jQuery projects and excersise. It was really hard for me as my English it was not half of what it is now, and it's still hard. 
I created a Twitter account and started tweeting those challenges  I had in those times I started, for those people who may feel the same and may have no help. After almost a year of self studying coding I noticed that self-studying is hard, specially if you're alone. I don't want to publish skills in the Twitter, I want to be a Newbie. I want to learn again, not to show I may know.
I learned that without support, it will be a very hard, slow way to see results. Even though you have enough determination, when you face challenges like not understanding technical English terms, you will, sooner or later, just stop. 

Now I found the 100DaysofCode challenge when hundreds of people are in, publishing every day their advances in Twitter and makes me feel I'm not alone. I am not alone, I like  to say.

<b>Day 1:</b>

<b>Today's progress:</b> I went back to the very beginning of Javascript excercices. To warm up again my forgotten skills. 

<b>Thoughts:</b> I was right, even though I still remember a lot of JS, as I started first with JS even before knowing what HTML was, I got stuck for a few minutes in the Celsius to F challenge. It was not a lot, but still, I should know better. It was the best desicion to start over.


<b>Day 2:</b>

<b>Today's progress:</b> I started getting away the day by day distractions. My cellphone seems to be the main issue of my distractions, not my computer. I will start shutting down all apps until done.

<b>Thoughts:</b>a Went back to my CodePen projects before, the JS, the Tribute page and the Portfolio, I think now that I have a better understanding of bootstrap, will rebuild them.
